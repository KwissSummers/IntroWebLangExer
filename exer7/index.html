<!--takes two inputs with type text, one has the id of price and the other is the id of quantity, the placeholders 
hold text information that is displayed to the user to inform them of what to input-->
<input type="text" id="txt-price" placeholder="Enter the price of the item">
<input type="text" id="txt-quantity" placeholder="Enter the quanity of the item">
<!--the button id=btn-submit line is a button object of sorts that can be interacted with, it displays the words
"Calculate" to convey the purpose of the button, meanwhile the div id=output line creates a output that is 
displayed in a form thats customized by the creator of the code -->
<button id="btn-submit">Calculate</button>
<div id="output"></div>

<!--it appears the script holds multiple variables that hold information for the different functions of the code,
apart from that it appears each variable has a function that allows it to retrieve a element id from the different
id's created above-->
<!--It appears the code below the variables hold different mechanics. For example the submitBtn variable is scripted
to wait for the event where it is interacted with (named click) before it activates the function/script tied to it.
Apart from that there seems to be variables that takes in the user input value to be amnipulated by the functions
within the code. It looks like among the functions is a if condition that check if the input is a number or not,
if it fails the check a "invalid Input" message is displayed to the user. However if the if statement is passed
successfully, it does a calculation for the total price, rounded to the 0.00 position to accurately represent
the money format. And lastly there appears to be a output statement that uses something called innerHTML to 
help display the different bits of information calculated  -->
